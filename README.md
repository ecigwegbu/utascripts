# utascripts

Demo Scripts For UnixTrainingAcademy.
These scripts are simple demos in suppport of the Unix Training Academy.
The scripts make some assumptions in order to run correctly:
They are based on RHEL8/9.
They have been tested on Oracle Virtual Box or AWS EC2 RHEL8 but:
for Virtual Box, you must have subscribed to Redhat Subscription Manager
for AWS EC2 they could run without above subscription but you need to make
sure the security groups are correctly set up.
Scripts targeted for just the Virtual box include -vb in the name.
Scripts targeted for AWS EC2 have -aws in the name.
